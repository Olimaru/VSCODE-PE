<blockquote>
<p style="color: white;"> 
The Ashbringer is a powerful sword named for its ability
to slaughter the undead and leave nothing but ash in its 
wake. The legendary sword was crafted by King Magni Bronzebeard 
on the Great Anvil of Ironforge, 
and was infused with the Holy Light.
Ashbringer shares its name with its original wielder, 
<a style="color: rgb(161, 51, 51)" href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alexandros_Mograine"> Alexandros Mograine </a>
, the former Highlord of the Order of the Silver Hand 
who employed the title of The Ashbringer.

<br>
<blockquote>
<p style="color: white;"> 
Baron Rivendare's Runeblade is a powerful bastard sword. It is 
<a style="color: rgb(161, 51, 51)" href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Baron_Rivendare"> Baron Rivendare</a>'s most prized possession, 
next to his undead steed, Deathcharger. 
The finely-crafted blade bears a false hilt and 
is etched with necromantic runes all down the blade. 
The blade pulses with cold power, 
seeming all too ready to draw blood from enemies. 
In anyone else's hands, the blade is simply a bastard sword. 
In the Baron's hands, however, 
the weapon becomes a keen frost/unholy bastard sword. 
The powerful blade also grants anyone who wields 
the blade fast healing. The sword also allows any wielder 
to cast Bloodlust on themselves.</p>

<br>
<blockquote>
<p style="color: white;"> 
Frostmourne was the mourneblade of the 
<a style="color: rgb(161, 51, 51)" href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lich_King">Lich King. </a>
A fearsome, rune-inscribed two-handed longsword,
it possessed the power to shatter and imprison the souls of 
its victims and could remake the living into mindless undead. 
Frostmourne was thrust from the Frozen Throne by the Lich King 
Ner'zhul and was taken up by Arthas Menethil in the wastes of 
Northrend during the Third War. It was wielded by Arthas both 
during his time as a death knight and as Lich King until it was 
destroyed by Tirion Fordring; in that time, the blade spilled 
the blood of kings, destroyed nations, and inflicted scars on 
the world that remain to this day. Few weapons have shaped modern 
history as much as Frostmourne. During the third invasion of 
the Burning Legion, a death knight hero reforged the shards of 
the blade into the Blades of the Fallen Prince.
