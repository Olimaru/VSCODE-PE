        <blockquote>
        <p style="color: white;"> 
        The Ashbringer is a powerful sword named for its ability
        to slaughter the undead and leave nothing but ash in its 
        wake. The legendary sword was crafted by King Magni Bronzebeard 
        on the Great Anvil of Ironforge, 
        and was infused with the Holy Light.
        Ashbringer shares its name with its original wielder,

        who employed the title of The Ashbringer.

        Baron Rivendare's Runeblade is a powerful bastard sword. It is 
        <a style="color: rgb(161, 51, 51)" href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Baron_Rivendare"> Baron Rivendare</a>'s most prized possession, 
        next to his undead steed, Deathcharger. 
        The finely-crafted blade bears a false hilt and 
        is etched with necromantic runes all down the blade. 
        The blade pulses with cold power, 
        seeming all too ready to draw blood from enemies. 
        In anyone else's hands, the blade is simply a bastard sword. 
        In the Baron's hands, however, 
        the weapon becomes a keen frost/unholy bastard sword. 
        The powerful blade also grants anyone who wields 
        the blade fast healing. The sword also allows any wielder 
        to cast Bloodlust on themselves.</p>

        Frostmourne was the mourneblade of the 
        <a style="color: rgb(161, 51, 51)" href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lich_King">Lich King. </a>
        A fearsome, rune-inscribed two-handed longsword,
        it possessed the power to shatter and imprison the souls of 
        its victims and could remake the living into mindless undead. 
        Frostmourne was thrust from the Frozen Throne by the Lich King 
        Ner'zhul and was taken up by Arthas Menethil in the wastes of 
        Northrend during the Third War. It was wielded by Arthas both 
        during his time as a death knight and as Lich King until it was 
        destroyed by Tirion Fordring; in that time, the blade spilled 
        the blood of kings, destroyed nations, and inflicted scars on 
        the world that remain to this day. Few weapons have shaped modern 
        history as much as Frostmourne. During the third invasion of 
        the Burning Legion, a death knight hero reforged the shards of 
        the blade into the Blades of the Fallen Prince.

        <blockquote>
        <p style="color: white;">
        Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker is the legendary sword once wielded by Thunderaan, Prince of Air. 
        The prince, son of Al'Akir the Windlord, was attacked by Ragnaros the Firelord, 
        in an attempt to heighten the already impressive power that the fire elemental held. 
        Ragnaros succeeded; however, Thunderaan's power could not be completely taken into his form. 
        What remained of Thunderaan was placed in a talisman of elemental binding, which was broken into two pieces. 
        The pieces were then given to the Firelord's two lieutenants, Baron Geddon and Garr, respectively the left and right halves. 
        These two halves are known as the
