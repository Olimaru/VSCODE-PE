        </div>
        <div class="herodescription"><a>
                Varian Wrynn was the King of Stormwind and High King of the Grand Alliance. During the First War
                when Varian was a young boy, his father King Llane was murdered and Stormwind was sacked by the Orcish
                Horde. His guardian and regent Anduin Lothar gathered the survivors and sailed to Lordaeron, where the
                Alliance of Lordaeron was formed. The Alliance defeated the Horde in the Second War and Stormwind was
                reclaimed, though at the cost of Lothar's life. Varian was crowned King of Stormwind and stood by King
                Terenas of Lordaeron as the Alliance began to fracture, but soon faced many internal problems. Varian
                was abducted by the Defias Brotherhood, formerly the Stonemasons, and went missing. He had managed to
                escape from the Defias but was suffering from memory loss and soon after enslaved by the Horde and
                became a gladiator in the Crimson Ring. After escaping his slavers, Varian discovered he was the missing
                King of Stormwind and his advisor Lady Katrana Prestor was revealed to be the black dragonflight
                broodmother Onyxia in disguise, who had manipulated the Defias and Nobles dispute, was behind Varian's
                kidnapping and created a duplicate of him using dark magic. With the help of his comrades, he was able
                to recover his true identity and finally defeat Onyxia.
                <br>
                Under his daring leadership, the humans of Stormwind led the Alliance to victory against the Lich King
                in Northrend. After the death of Highlord Bolvar Fordragon and Alliance forces at the Wrathgate, Varian
                declared war on the Horde and sought to bolster their strategic holdings against their perennial
                enemy. Known for his tenacity and fierce will, King Varian Wrynn was committed to protecting the
                Alliance's interests and raising his son Anduin to follow in his place. With the world plunged into
                chaos by the great Cataclysm, he earned the respect of the night elves, dwarves, and other Alliance
                races and took up military leadership of the Alliance as High King, vowing to forge a new destiny for
                Azeroth. The war with the Horde was finally brought to an end following the victory in the Siege of
                Orgrimmar.
                <br>
                Leading the Alliance armies against the Burning Legion at the Broken Shore, Varian fell in battle at the
                gates of the Tomb of Sargeras, sacrificing himself to allow the Alliance forces to escape. Before
                staying behind to fight, Varian entrusted Genn Greymane with a letter to his son Anduin, advising him
                that one must be willing to fight in order to preserve peace. In the aftermath of the battle, he was
                succeeded by Anduin as King of Stormwind and High King of the Alliance.
