                Anduin Llane Wrynn is the King of Stormwind, High King of the Alliance, and commander of all Alliance
                forces. When Anduin was just a boy, his father, King Varian Wrynn, was kidnapped. In Varian's absence,
                Anduin was named King of Stormwind under the regency of Bolvar Fordragon. In contrast to his decisive
                warrior father, Anduin is contemplative and diplomatic, and around the time of the Cataclysm, he decided
                to pursue the path of a priest of the Church of the Holy Light. Years later, Stormwind tragically lost
                its king in battle against the invading demons of the Burning Legion. Following Varian's death, Anduin
                permanently assumed the throne of Stormwind. In the face of the Legion's onslaught, Anduin grew certain
                that lasting peace would not be achieved without bloodshed, and as he worked to save lives and fend off
                the demons' advance, Anduin was forced to reconcile his yearning for peace with the necessity for
                war. In the wake of the Burning Legion's defeat, a global war with the Horde — now led by Warchief
                Sylvanas Windrunner — threatened everything that Anduin held dear. Though he led the armies of the
                Alliance across Azeroth, he remained dedicated to putting an end to the bloodshed, even if meant getting
                his hands dirty. The war ended with Sylvanas abandoning the Horde, but she subsequently tore open a
                gateway into the Shadowlands, the realm of death, and her allies brought Anduin and other leaders of
                Azeroth into captivity in the Maw. Though the other captives were freed, Anduin remained a prisoner of
                Sylvanas and her ally, Zovaal the Jailer, and was ultimately subjugated by the latter's Domination magic
                and turned into a vessel forced to carry out the Jailer's will. Zovaal used Anduin to devastating effect
                in order to come closer to achieving his goals, but with the help of Azeroth's heroes Anduin eventually
                managed to free himself from the Jailer's control. Afterward, he decided that he would not yet return to
                Azeroth as he needed more time to recover from his traumatic experiences.

                Anduin was named after two venerated figures of Stormwind history: his grandfather King Llane Wrynn and
                the legendary Sir Anduin Lothar. As of Dragonflight, Anduin is 25 years old.
