        <div class="herodescription"><a>
                Illidan Stormrage, commonly known as the Betrayer, is the first of the demon hunters, the former
                self-proclaimed Lord of Outland, the former ruler of the Black Temple, and the original leader of the
                Illidari. Originally a powerful night elf sorcerer, Illidan officially betrayed his people by
                defecting to the demonic Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients, though his reasons for doing so
                were noble as he secretly aimed to repel the Legion's invasion. He eventually returned to the side
                of his fellow night elves, but his creation of a second Well of Eternity at the end of the war caused
                his people to name him "Betrayer" and imprison him in the Barrow Deeps below Mount Hyjal. There he
                remained for over 10,000 years, watched over by the warden Maiev Shadowsong and her Watchers.

                When the Legion invaded Azeroth once more during the Third War, Tyrande freed Illidan from his prison in
                order to have him battle the demons once more. He subsequently consumed the fel energies of the Skull of
                Gul'dan and transformed into a demon in order to defeat the dreadlord Tichondrius, an act for which he
                was banished by Malfurion. After the Legion's defeat at the end of the war, Illidan decided to feign
                allegiance to the demon lord Kil'jaeden by agreeing to destroy Kil'jaeden's traitorous creation, the
                Lich King, as a way to learn more about his true foe: the Burning Legion. Illidan later traveled with his allies to the Lich King's stronghold of Icecrown for one last
                attempt to complete Kil'jaeden's mission, but he was eventually thwarted and nearly killed by the Lich
                King's champion, the death knight Arthas Menethil.

                Returning to Outland, Illidan dropped all pretense of serving Kil'jaeden and mustered his army—the
                Illidari—to begin his true war against the Burning Legion. Despite succeeding in
                destroying the demon stronghold of Nathreza, the Betrayer was ultimately cornered and struck down within
                his own sanctum by Akama, a group of Azerothian adventurers, and his vengeful former jailer, Maiev.
                Maiev subsequently brought Illidan's corpse to the Vault of the Wardens so that his spirit could suffer
                the rest of his eternal sentence. There it remained for years until the Legion invaded once more.

                A struggle for Illidan's soul ensued between the Legion and the forces of Azeroth, including the
                remaining Illidari, culminating in Illidan's resurrection atop the Nighthold. The Betrayer subsequently
                joined forces with Azeroth's defenders as they battled the Legion across the Broken Shore and within the
                Tomb of Sargeras. During a battle with Kil'jaeden in the Twisting Nether, Illidan used an artifact known
                as the Sargerite Keystone to open a rift that brought the worlds of Azeroth and Argus within reach of
                each other. Illidan accompanied Azeroth's champions as they traveled to Argus to battle the Legion
                alongside the Army of the Light, whose leader—the prime naaru Xe'ra—believed that Illidan was the Chosen
                One, a hero of the Light prophesied to end the age of demons. Illidan rejected the idea of
                having his destiny forged for him and killed Xe'ra when the naaru tried to forcibly infuse him with the
                Light. The Army of the Light and their allies eventually assaulted Sargeras' seat of power, Antorus,
                and freed the captive spirits of the titan Pantheon, who imprisoned Sargeras at the Seat of the Pantheon
                for his transgressions. While the rest of Azeroth's heroes returned home to their world, Illidan chose
                to remain behind, becoming Sargeras' jailor.
