        <div class="herodescription"><a>
                Lord Uther the Lightbringer, was the first of the five paladins of the
                Knights of the Silver Hand. Once a knight of Lordaeron and a follower of the Church of the Holy Light,
                under the spiritual<br>
                advising of Alonsus Faol, he became the Supreme leader of the Order of the Silver Hand during the Second
                War, and led his brothers in arms against the orcs of the Old Horde. He was held to be the wisest and
                most noble of all the holy paladins. Following the war, Uther and his paladins kept the peace in
                Lordaeron for years, settling civil disputes and quelling demi-human uprisings throughout the realm. A
                hero of the Alliance of Lordaeron, and a faithful ally of King Terenas Menethil II, he became the master
                of his son Prince Arthas and made him a paladin of the order. During the Third War, Uther fought the undead across the
                Kingdom of Lordaeron and investigated the source of the Plague of Undeath. When Arthas ordered the Culling of
                Stratholme, Uther refused to purge the city and its infected citizens and departed with his men to warn the king after
                the Silver Hand was suspended by the prince. During the Scourging of Lordaeron, Uther was betrayed and murdered by his
                beloved pupil, while defending the urn carrying the ashes of Terenas at Andorhal.
                <br>
                At the moment of his death, Frostmourne shattered Uther's soul into two fragments, with one being held captive inside
                the mourneblade while another was brought to the Shadowlands plane of Bastion to become one of the kyrian, albeit with
                fragmented memories. Uther played a key role in the rise of the rebel Forsworn alongside their leader, Devos, but he
                later realized the error of his ways. After his memories and soul were healed, he led the Forsworn to rejoin the rest of
                the kyrians and helped the heroes of Azeroth to stop Zovaal the Jailer.
