        </div>
        <div class="herodescription"><a>
                Arthas Menethil was once a paladin of the Silver Hand and the crown prince of Lordaeron. However, he
                was corrupted by the cursed blade Frostmourne in a bid to save his people. Arthas Menethil was a
                promising young Paladin
                trained in combat by Muradin Bronzebeard and learned the ways of the Light under Uther the Lightbringer.
                He was inducted into the Knights of the Silver Hand. <br>When a plague gripped the northlands of
                Lordaeron,
                Arthas investigated it with Jaina Proudmoore and discovered Kel'Thuzad's plans to infect outlying
                villages under the orders of the dreadlord Mal'Ganis. They set out to stop the demon before he could
                reach his next target: the city of Stratholme. But they arrived too late, and the citizens had already
                consumed poisoned grain that would doom them to rise into undeath. To stop the plague from spreading
                further, Arthas ordered his knights to purge the entire city. Uther and Jaina were horrified and refused
                to obey his cruel command. Those who remained loyal to Arthas joined him and began the Culling of
                Stratholme. <br>Arthas sought vengeance upon Mal'Ganis, but the demon slipped away to the frozen land of
                Northrend.
                Arthas followed him and became the Lich King after driving his blade through the ice, releasing the
                spirit of Ner'Zhul from its icy prison and merging into one. The Lich King Arthas Menethil is the main
                antagonist in World of Warcraft's Wrath of the Lich King
                expansion, where he serves as the primary antagonist and a raid boss. Arthas Menethil's story is one of
                the most tragic in the Warcraft franchise, with his character going from an earnest young prince and
                paladin trying desperately to save his people to a cackling villain who betrayed and defeated Illidan.
                The lesson of Arthas is that power corrupts, and he ultimately became the Lich King, ruling over the
                Scourge and becoming one of the most famous villains in World of Warcraft history.
